# GSM A5/1 Cipher Generator
This program is designed to generate and decrypt GSM A5/1 ciphertext.

# TODO 
- Separate test cases into separate file (and make better ones)
- Offer to accept user input to generate ciphertext based on given plaintext and a key and frame number
- Offer to accept user input to decrypt ciphertext using given values or magic tables/brute force/...
- Write test cases and better documentation for above functionality
